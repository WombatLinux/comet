# The Comet Package Manager Documentation

## What is Comet?
Comet is the official package manager of [Wombat Linux](http://wombatlinux.org). Designed for speed, ease of use, and stability, its key 
feature is self-containment. Comet relies on minimal external dependencies, making it suitable for even the most minimal 
systems, including those without an existing package manager.

## Why Comet?
The self-contained nature of Comet ensures compatibility with any system that supports the correct libc version. This 
unique feature significantly reduces the installation size and ISO size of Wombat Linux, allowing for a compact yet 
fully-functional Linux distribution.

## Installation
As the official package manager for [Wombat Linux](http://wombatlinux.org), Comet comes pre-installed with the 
distribution. For users of other Linux systems, Comet can be installed by downloading the latest release from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/wombatlinux/comet/releases) or by building it from source. For source builds, 
please refer to the "Building from Source" section in the [README.md](../README.md) file.

## Usage
Comet's user-friendly command-line interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use. To access usage information, 
run `comet --help`. Detailed usage documentation is also available in the 
[Comet CLI documentation](../comet-cli/README.md).
